### The Menu Screen:
> After successful login the user is prompted with a list of restaurants (for now includes the restaurants of the campus) for which he/she can select a restaurant and the menu will be opened on the next activity. The menu includes various food items, their prices and an option to mark an item as favourite for future reference. Various items can be added, and the total with added taxes are displayed on the *Cart(next)* page.
